**What is Developer Circles from Facebook?**
```
Developer Circles from Facebook are communities of innovators, where aspiring and experienced developers 
receive free tools to build new skills, grow ideas and boost their careers.
Each Circle is managed by a developer community leader who supports an online Facebook Group,
hosts local events, and shares the latest news on Facebook technologies.
Members benefit from expanding their networks with fellow developers and industry experts, 
gaining special access to educational resources from the Facebook team and partners, 
and taking part in a range of skillset and career-building initiatives.
